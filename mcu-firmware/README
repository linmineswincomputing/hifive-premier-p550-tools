MCU using JTAG interface.

Firmware flashing steps
-----------------------
1] Connect MCU JTAG interface to linux PC.
	i.e.
	- Connect carrier board USB type C port to PC USB port. Carrier board
	USB type C port internally connected to MCU JTAG interface.

2] Copy mcu-firmware directory to PC.

3] Download jtag prgramming tool i.e. "openocd" into PC.

4] Set openocd tool path in "start_stm32.sh" script and run the script.
	e.g.
	# ./start_stm32.sh 

5] Open telnet console in PC.
	e.g.
	# telnet 127.0.0.1 4444
