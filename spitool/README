esdebug is used for SoC debugging that uses SPI interface.

In this debugging method, SoC acts as SPI slave and external
SPI master communicates with this SPI slave to get access of the system.

This tool depends on some libraries which are given along with the tool.
Add library path to your environment.
For example:
# export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path where libraries are present>

Usage: esdebug <option> <arguments>

Examples:
1. To read SoC registers
./esdebug --rw 0x51810668 

2. To write SoC registers
./esdebug --ww 0x51810668,0xdeadbeef
